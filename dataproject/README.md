# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Rainy days in Copenhagen** and is about the danish bike habits and how they are affected by the weather conditions in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply datasets from DMI and Yahoo Finance. The datasets are imported trough API's.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
``pip install dmi-open-data``
``pip install yfinance``
``pip install yahoofinancials``
