# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Rainy days in Copenhagen** and is about the danish bike habits and how they are affected by the weather conditions in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. dataX.csv (*source*) 
1. dataY.csv (*source*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
